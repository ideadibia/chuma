    <p>One of Fela's famous memes says music is spiritual, and I think he was right.</p>
    <p>We always hear of music and what we feel when we listen to certain types of music, but we tend to listen to one genre over the other. For me, that genre is Hip-Hop. Time and time again, I listen to a bit of pop or country or reggae, but it's usually Rap/Hip-Hop.</p>
    <p>Also, music can inspire, I believe that much. And people do too. We listen to music when we travel, are happy, when we play or work.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>My idea for this project is to help people improve their moods based on the music they listen and to trust the music to do so. I collected responses from people based on a <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/FGJWXKZ">simple survey</a> that asks what song makes we think of happiness, sleep, creativity or relaxation. The playlists are below, if you felt the emotions after listening please let me know.</p>
